"How to configure DC to look on a different App server for the SSP? 

I have a single Application server with the RES console installed, and then a separate application server with the XU, the ssp ear, etc. on that one. Each app server is configured separately with respective ports. for example, mgmt server (with the RES console only) has port 8000, and the runtime server (with all of the runtime components) has port 9000.

The problem I am running into is the following:

When I am trying to run a DVS test suite from Decision Center against RES, (my server endpoint in Decision Center is configured as http://hostname:port/res)

I am getting a ""the host and port are responsive but the ""/testing/sspService"" cannot be found. This is expected if it is looking on the same server as the RES console since the application (ssp) is not deployed there.

However, I cannot seem to configure the RES console to not assume that the ssp is running on the same port.","First remember to pack all your XOMs (eXecutable Object Model) into the ssp.war following the documentation [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/topic/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/Content/Business_Rules/Documentation/_pubskel/JRules/ps_JRules_Global720.html]. 

Then make sure the SSP (ssp.war) is deployed on each server along with a XU connection factory and the appropriate datasource definition. 

 

Then create your own SSP resolver, add it to the teamserver.war and set the teamserver.defaultSSPResolver.class property to this class following this specification [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/brjrules/v7r1/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.websphere.ilog.jrules.doc/html/api/html/ilog/rules/teamserver/model/testing/IlrSSPResolver.html]. 

 

By implementing your own method IlrSSPResolver.getSSPURL(String serverName,URL url), you will be able to point to something else than the default provider. 

The default provider uses the url of the Rule Execution Server passed in parameter and replaces the application name with testing. 

A simple implementation can use the server name to return a specific server URL."

Is there a best practice to refresh the WSP if I modified my WSDL?","In a WS Proxy, you can refresh WSDL from an URL using WSDL Cache policy. However, if the WSDL is hosted on the DataPower appliance, such as in local:///, rather than on an external URL, the WSDL Cache Policy does not apply. 

For instance, changes made to local:///test.wsdl are not picked up by WS Proxy although there is a WSDL Cache policy setting the URL Match expression to local:///test.wsdl. 

This issue was reported to Quality Engineering but it was determined that the DataPower device is working as designed. The device will not poll WSDL files on the local store.

"Why is the reload() not clearing the attribute cache so I can see my newly updated LDAP data in real time? You are leveraging the reload() functionality as described in the blog post:
