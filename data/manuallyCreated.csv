What is Simplis,"SIMPLIS is a circuit simulator designed for rapid modelling of switching power systems. An acronym for
�SIMulation for Piecewise LInear System�, it is supplied with our SIMetrix/SIMPLIS product range."
Why simulate,"Integrated circuit designers have been using analog simulation software for nearly five decades. The
difficulty of bread-boarding and high production engineering costs have made the use of such software
essential."
What are the system requirements,"Windows 11 Home, Pro (including variants) and Enterprise
Windows 10 Home, Pro and Enterprise - 64 bit editions

SIMetrix will run satisfactorily on any system that meets all the following requirements:
1. The system is running one of supported operating systems listed above
2. The system meets the minimum hardware requirement for the operating system
3. The system�s display has a"
Where do I find tutorials,"On Windows the example files are distributed as packages and are installed under
C:\ProgramData\SIMetrix Technologies\SIMetrix900\Updater\installed but it is not intended that they are
used from that location. Instead they will be copied to your �My Documents- folder when SIMetrix starts
for the first time, but only if you accept the option to do so."
What is a tutorial,"This tutorial demonstrates a basic simulation on a ready to run to circuit. All you need to do is load the
circuit and press F9 to run it. We will then make a few changes to the circuit and make some extra plots."
How do I create a schematic,"The schematic editor has been designed to be intuitive to use and you may not need to read too much about
it. Here we describe the less obvious procedures.If you have SIMetrix/SIMPLIS, make sure you are in the
correct mode before entering a schematic. See above section."
How do I place a part,"If it is a simple device which only needs a value such as a resistor or capacitor, select the appropriate
symbol from the tool bar or Place menu. For other devices that require a part number, it is easiest to use
the model library browser. Select menu Place | From Model Library and select your desired device."
How do I change a part,"First select it then double click or select schematic popup Edit Part... or press F7. A dialog box
appropriate for the type of part will be displayed. For devices requiring a model name, a list of available
types will appear."
"How do I rotate, mirror, flip, or transform a part","Use the Rotate toolbar button (see diagram above) or key F5 to rotate a part.
This operation can be performed while a part is being placed or while a block is being moved or copied
(see below).
You can also select a part or block then press the rotate button/key to rotate in-situ.
To mirror a part or block through the y-axis, press the Mirror toolbar button or F6 key.
To flip a part or block (mirror about x-axis), press Flip button or press shift-F6."
How do I add wiring,"There are a number of ways of placing a wire:
Method 1: Place the mouse cursor close to an unselected symbol pin or wire end. Notice the cursor shape
change to depict a pen symbol. Now left click to mark the start point then left click again to mark the final
point. SIMetrix will automatically route the wire for you. You can also mark intermediate points if you
would prefer to define the precise route rather than accept the auto-routed connection.
Method 2: If you have a three button mouse or scroll wheel mouse you can start a wire by clicking the
middle button/scroll wheel. Clicking the middle button or scroll wheel a second time will complete the
wire and start a new one. Click the right button or press escape to terminate wiring.
Method 3: Start a wire by pressing F3 or double clicking the left button. Single clicking the left button will
complete the wire and start a new one. Click the right button or press escape to terminate wiring.
Method 4: Press the Wiring tool button on the toolbar. You can start a wire by single clicking the left
button, otherwise continue as described above. Press the Wire button again to cancel this mode."
What are the circuit rules,"The following design rules must be observed for the simulation to run correctly. Note that most circuits
obey them anyway and they do not impose serious limitations on the capability of the simulator.
- There must always be at least one ground symbol on every circuit.
- Every node on the circuit must have a dc path to ground. For example, two capacitors in series form
a node which does not have DC path to ground. If you do have a floating node, you can provide a
DC path to ground by connecting a high value resistor (e.g. 1G) between it and ground. Capacitors
without initial conditions do not have a DC path. But if you set an initial condition on a capacitor a
DC path is formed and this method is an alternative to using a resistor to provide a DC path.
Also note that inductors with an initial condition do not have a DC path. This is because they are
treated as a constant current during the calculation of the DC bias point.
If using a high value resistor to make a DC path for a transformer winding, we recommend that you
also place a low value capacitor in parallel with it. This is not always necessary but can help avoid
problems with transient analysis convergence. It is best to choose a realistic value that would
represent what the capacitance would really be in the real-world circuit.
- There must not be any zero resistance loops constructed from voltage sources, inductors without
initial conditions or capacitors with initial conditions. If you do have such loops you can insert a low
value resistor. You should choose a value that represents what the resistance would be in the real
world, e.g. the actual winding resistance of an inductor, and never use an unrealistically small value.
Very small resistances (e.g. 1 fempto-Ohm) can cause convergence problems.
For loops containing inductors you can break the loop by adding an initial condition to the inductor
instead of adding a resistor.
Failure to observe the above usually leads to a Singular Matrix error."
How do I set up a SIMEtrix Simulation,"In this section we explain how to setup the most commonly used analysis modes in both SIMetrix and
SIMPLIS (SIMetrix/SIMPLIS product only)
For more comprehensive details on analysis modes, see Analysis Modes for SIMetrix and SIMPLIS
Analysis Modes for SIMPLIS ."
How do I run the simulator,"You can run the simulator using a number of methods:
- Select the Simulator | Run Schematic menu item
- Press F9
- Click the Run button in the Simulator | Choose Analysis... dialog box
- Click on the play button
A dialog box will show the status of the simulation.
You can pause the simulation by selecting the Pause button on the simulator status dialog box. To restart
select the Resume button (the Pause button changes name when simulation pauses) or the Simulator |
Resume menu item. There is no obligation to resume a simulation that has been paused. If you start a new
run after having paused the previous one, you will be asked whether you wish to abandon the pending
simulation run."
How do I plot results,"SIMetrix provides two methods of creating plots of simulated results.
The first approach is to fix voltage or current probes to the schematic before or during a run. SIMetrix will
then generate graphs of the selected voltages and/or currents automatically. The probes have a wide range

SIMetrix/SIMPLIS User�s Manual
4.6. Plotting Simulation Results
of options which allow you to specify - for example - how the graphs are organised and when and how
often they are updated.
The second approach is to randomly probe the circuit after the run is complete. (You can also do this
during a run by pausing first). With this approach, the graph will be created as you point the probe but will
not be updated on a new run.
You do not need to make any decisions on how you wish to probe your circuit before starting the run. You
can enter a circuit without any fixed probes, run it, then randomly probe afterwards. Alternatively, you can
place - say - a single fixed probe on an obvious point of interest, then randomly probe to investigate the
detailed behaviour of your circuit.
Fixed schematic probes are limited to single ended voltages and currents and differential voltages. The
random probing method allows you to plot anything you like including device power, FFTs, arbitrary
expressions of simulation results and X-Y plots such as Nyquist diagrams. It is possible to set up fixed
probes to plot arbitrary expressions of signals but this requires manually entering the underlying simulator
command, the .GRAPH control. There is no direct schematic support for this. For details of the .GRAPH
control see the �Command Reference- chapter of the Simulator Reference Manual."
