CAUSE
 

*In this note, please refer to Java Versioning: Java Version.Release.ServiceRelease.FixPack 
ex: Java 7.1.4.6 is the same as Java 7.1 SR4 FP6 is the same as Java 7 R1 SR4 FP6. 
The IBM JVM will automatically use compressed references [http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/javasdk/v6r0/topic/com.ibm.java.doc.diagnostics.60/diag/understanding/mm_compressed_references.html]when using a maximum heap size less than 25GB. This automated behavior was introduced in Java 6.1.5.0 and Java 7.0.4.0*. Compressed references (CR) decreases the size of Java objects making better use of available memory space. This better use of space results in improved JVM performance. *(Java 7.0.1.1 and later uses compressed references by default on z/OS) 

See Introducing WebSphere Compressed Reference Technology [ftp://public.dhe.ibm.com/software/webserver/appserv/was/WAS_V7_64-bit_performance.pdf] for detailed information on how Compressed References work. 

""When using compressed references, the size of the field used in the Java object for the Class Pointer and the Monitor/Lock is 32 bits instead of the 64bits that would be available in non-compressed mode. Because we are using 32 bits to store the location of these, and they are located in native (non-Java heap) memory, they must be allocated in the first 4GB of the address space - the maximum range we can address with the 32 bits."""

Where is WAS getting this information from?

We are using WAS ND v8.5.5.0. We are running Oracle Database 12c Enterprise Edition Release 12.1.0.2.0 - 64bit Production. The JDBC driver is ojdbc6.jar - Oracle 11.1.0.7.0-Production JDBC 4.0 compiled with JDK6.

There is another older driver ojdbc14.jar

When I do a test connection, I can see the JDBC Driver version is 9.2.0.1.0, but in the JDBC providers I have specified ojdbc6.jar. so it should show 11.1.0.7.0 but it is showing 9.2.0.1.0. why it is showing 9.2.0.1.0?

If we keep only ojdbc6.jar and do a test connection it is giving the correct JDBC Drivers version as it is same with ojdbc6.jar. But when we keep both ojdbc6.jar and ojdbc14.jar it is not giving the correct JDBC Driver version looks it is giving ojdbc14.jar version.

JDBC providers are pointed to ojdbc6.jar, but why it is showing a different JDBC driver version?","When multiple versions of the JDBC driver are configured in WebSphere Application Server, irrespective of the scopes, there is a possibility of a collision of the classes and we cannot predict from which version of the driver jar the class got loaded."

Is it possible to make where filter to case insensitive in My Inbox? Workplace OOTB feature - 'Tasks-->My Inbox--> Filter inbox based on field where' the filter is case sensitive. but our expected result is case insensitive. We have already checked 'Force case-insensitive search'. Our expectation it should return the same work items what ever we use 'TEST' or 'test'. ,"ICN does not provide a feature to turn on or off case sensitive searches. All metadata searches in ICN are case sensitive by default. However, depending on the repository, case insensitive searches can be performed by doing the following:
- For FileNet P8 repositories; set the Force Case Insensitive Search flag on the object store. 
- For Content Manager repositories; the administrator will firstly need to enable text search on metadata, then a text search will need to be done in ICN against the metadata by enclosing the metadata value in double quotes.

Alternatively, a request filter can be written to change the case of a query to all upper or all lower case."

Getting Delay or AMQ9716: Remote SSL certificate revocation status check failed when trying to start a MQ SSL channel, please help resolve this? The error can occur on the MQ server or also a MQ client application..

AMQ9716: Remote SSL certificate revocation status check failed

Remote SSL certificate revocation status check failed for channel '???'.

EXPLANATION: WebSphere MQ failed to determine the revocation status of the remote SSL
certificate for one of the following reasons:

(a) The channel was unable to contact any of the CRL servers or OCSP responders for the certificate.
(b) None of the OCSP responders contacted knows the revocation status of the certificate.
(c) An OCSP response was received, but the digital signature of the response could not be verified.","With the release of WebSphere MQ V7.0.1.0 the use of OCSP certificate revocation checking was included. With this new feature, most likely your SSL certificates have a OCSP AuthorityInfoAccess (AIA) certificate extension embedded inside them. 


This was ignored before V7.0.1.0. Now it is being used to verify the certificate. The most likely cause of the failure is that the system can not access the servers listed in the AIA. This then returns a UNKNOWN status when the check is done. The default action for MQ is to not allow the channel to start and the AMQ9716 to be reported when the UNKNOWN is returned."

SYMPTOM
Situation in ITM is no longer true but event is not cleared in OMNIbus.


DIAGNOSING THE PROBLEM
The iptrace shows that the EIF probe on the OMNIbus side is resetting/closing(<RST>) the TCP/IP connection after it receives the event and it never shows up in the EIF logs, so the event is just dropped."

"About implementation and specification in a File entry of type Logical under Component I use Rhapsody for C++ and want to add a .c/.h file combo.

I know I can easily do this by adding 2 File entries under the Component level: one being Implementation type and the other Specification. Then add the appropriate code in the respective Text Elements.

Alternatively I can do the equivalent by having a single File entry of type Logical that will generate 2 files (and change the CG:ImplementationExternsion property changed to .c).

However when the type is set to Logical, I don't know where to place the code for the Implementation and the code for the Specification so that they end up each in the right file. Right now, whatever I put in the Text Element ends up in both files.

What is the correct number of datasource connections for Portal? What is the best way to figure out how to configure the maximum number of datasource connections for my Portal server? What factors are involved that I need watch out for? ,"When tuning WebSphere Portal at version 6.0 and beyond, one of the concerns that arises is how should one tune the maximum number of Portal datasources. Portal can and does make heavy internal use of datasources, so miscalculating this (maximum) value can have a significant impact on system behavior. Out of the box, the default maximum setting is 50. This may or may not be sufficient for any given system. 

Each Portal request may make any number of database (DB) requests ranging for none to several.. Further, customized portlets and PPR (Parallel Portlet Rendering) may cause several concurrent DB requests. By default, the maximum number of WebContainer threads is also set to 50. Therefore the ratio between the maximum number of Portal datasource connections to the maximum number of Portal WebContainer threads is 1:1. Support has found that this ratio is often too low for the best performance. In the past, there have been recommendations of this ratio as high as of 2:1 or even 2.5:1. 

However, these values caused concern in large deployments where the TOTAL number of maximum datasource connections might start to place a strain on backend resources. Recent analysis suggests that these ratio values may be safely reduced to 1.25: 1 for all Portal datasource, with the exception of the jcrDB when WCM is used extensively. In this case, we recommend a ratio of 1.5:1"

","WebSphere Portal has no built-in mechanism or configuration setting to limit the number of times a user id may log in. Unexpected behavior may occur if the same id is logged in more than once and this is not supported.

Most of the related issues were resolved in WebSphere Portal 5.1. However, you may still encounter exceptions or side-effects if you access the Portal in multiple browser windows using the same user id, whether or not the authentication requests take place on separate physical hosts.

It may be possible to prevent multiple logins by writing custom ""tracking code."" Contact IBM Services for assistance to undertake such a project. WebSphere Portal Development does not have any sample code.

If you wish to write your own code, some of the issues to be aware of are (this is not an inclusive list):

-- Multiple logins may take place on different nodes in a cluster. This means some cluster-wide mechanism would have to be in place to keep track of the logged-in users. Look at the WebSphere Application Server DistributedMap interface.

-- There should be a fail-safe way to track user logout (explicit logout and session timeout). Using a session listener might be a possibility. 

-- If a user closes the browser without logging out, that user must wait for a session timeout before logging in again. Otherwise, there should be a ""force simultaneous login"" option in the login user interface.

For load testing, use unique user ids or virtual users."

"How to define shared libraries for ODM ruleApps on WAS traditional? What is the proper way to define a shared lib for RuleApps without giving up the isolated mode of the XU resource adapter? Is it ""works as designed"" that isolating of the XU prevents the resource adapter from seeing shared lib classes from other classloaders? ","In order to support the existence of multiple versions of the driver jars, the ""Isolate this resource provider"" configuration helps to ensure there are no conflicts. This needs to be configured on each JDBC Provider. You cannot isolate only one resource provider, all the provider configurations in different scopes will have to be configured with the ""Isolate this resource provider"" setting. In this scenario, the resource provider classes from different versions of the jars are not imported or accessed to verify if the isolation has indeed worked. In order to use the server-scoped resource provider the datasource using the server-scoped jdbc provider will have to be referenced from the application after isolating the resource providers and using a resource reference in the application. 


Go to the JDBC Provider and enable ""isolate the resource provider"". When ""Isolate this resource provider"" is enabled, it ensures that only the jar that was specified in the classpath will be used for all the datasources under that particular JDBC provider."
"Is there a limit to the number of items that can be listed within an ""in"" list as part of a where clause? Is there a limit to the number of items that can be listed within an ""in"" list as part of a where clause? ","The short answer is no limit.


By default we create a virtual table for any ""in list"" with more than 5 values.

The only limitation with large ""in list"" statements would be the memory needed to compile the query. If the query is too complex, you can potentially run out of memory, but that will not affect other sessions since this happens inside the postgres process assigned to that session. The parameter that is responsible for this behaviour is inlist_threshold and it is safe to increase this value to 100, but not more."

Currently experiencing a performance issue with an application running on a DB2 client, the stack traces reveals that multiple segment() calls are being issued by DB2 and they are failing. What can be done to resolve this issue? ","The solution is to issue the following command at the DB2 client:

db2trc alloc

This will then create the necessary IPC resources, and prevent the semget() calls from failing (since the semget() call now has IPC resources that it can use). The potential performance problem will thus be avoided.

The failed semget() operations are more of a concern for Solaris Operating Environment, Linux®, HP-UX and AIX® operating systems, in terms of performance implications. Windows® will not have this problem due to its specific architecture.

The db2trc alloc command should be invoked every time the client is restarted, and therefore it is recommended to add this command to a startup script."

Minimum Size of QR Code for Datacap to identify correctly What is the recommended minimum size of the barcode for the Datacap to identify it properly.,"To optimize barcode recognition: 

 * The width of the thinnest bar (called the X-dimension) must be at least one pixel, and two pixels are recommended for best results. At 200 DPI this means each bar must be at least .01 inch. Generally this translates to about 4 to 5 characters per inch. 
 * The X-dimension or width of the narrowest black bar and white space between bars must be at least 20 mils (1/50 inch, 1/2 mm). When scanned perfectly at 200 DPI this would result in 4 pixels, and at 300 DPI 6 pixels. 
 * For Code 39 symbols: a 20 mil X-dimension results in a density of approximately 3.6 characters per inch. Optimally the height should be at least 1/4 inch or 15% of the width, whichever is greater, though this is not an absolute requirement. The minimum quiet zone (white space before and after the bar code) specified by the standard is 1/5 inch."
How to enable the snippet results cache in the Netezza Platform Software releases? How to enable the snippet results cache in the Netezza Platform Software releases? ,"To enable the feature on a session level and test the snippet results cache behavior, you must pause the NPS system, set the variable, and resume the system, as follows: 

nzsystem pause -force
nzsystem set -arg system.srcMode=1 -force
nzsystem resume

This setting remains in effect until the database is restarted. You can add the definition to the system.cfg file to keep the setting in effect after the Netezza software restarts:


 1. Log in to the Netezza system as the nz user account.
    
 2. With any text editor, open the /nz/data/config/system.cfg file. 
    
 3. Look for a system.srcMode definition in the file to make sure that one is not already present and/or commented out. If you find an entry, make sure that system.srcMode=1 is set and not commented out with a # character. If you cannot find an entry, add system.srcMode=1 to the file. 
    
 4. Save and close the system.cfg file.
    
 5. Stop and restart the NPS software using the nzstop and then the nzstart commands."

"Why is RPT script for secure application failing during RRT agent playback with URL Unavailable ? 

In the ITCAM for Transactions, Robotic Response Time agent (t6) - the Rational Performance Tester (RPT) scripts playback is failing for specific secure applications (ones that use https). The scripts which invoke the http URLs work fine.

","SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and TLS (Transport Layer Security) are transport layer protocols. Ciphers implement security by providing the encryption mechanism. 

TLS is the new protocol. SSL protocol got up to version 3.0. In effect, TLS 1.0 is SSL 3.1. Currently, TLS versions include TLS 1.1 and 1.2. Each new version adds new features and modifies internal details. 

Whether the RRT agent supports TLS1.1/1.2 depends on whether the underlying JRE supports TLS 1.1/1.2. The JRE that supports the RRT agent and the JRE that supports RPT workbench must both support the same version of TLS and the same ciphers."
